# My Antennae Never Go Offline (M.A.N.G.O)

DESCRIPTION

This is a mini-mod that attempts to rebalance the transmission of science data. I personally got 
abosolutely sick to death of seeing the "not enough power! antenna retracting!" spam message 
everytime I tried to send something. What bugged me the most was why would any space agency use 
an antenna that is incapable of transmitting the data it needs? Would they use an engine that can't 
always get into orbit? Or it can but only if the wind's blowing a certain way?

In a nutshell, this mod looks at the vessel and checks the number of solar panels and their 
ability to generate electricity, as well as the number/type of antennae and their ability 
to transmit data.

Depending on the results of the above, it then sets a transmission time in a balanced fashion 
(basically more/better solar panels/antennae = less transmission time), reduces the electricty 
usage to help prevent the no power spam, and then reduces the amount of electricity a solar 
panel generates as means of payment/compensation.

The end result is the player should be able to transmit all data at the cost of TIME rather than 
ELECTRICITY; so the transmission will go through but it will take longer.


INSTRUCTIONS

- the mod is passive in as much as it is always active
- as stated above, you are rewarded for having extra/better solar panels/antenna so always look to
  upgrade them when possible
- if you have NO solar panels / antennae onboard, the mod will disable itself.
- simply transmit your data as normal. Assuming you have some power and the conditions above are met, 
  the transmission should go through but will take longer than normal.
- when you unlock the top end solar panels / antennae, you may find the transmissions go through as 
  quickly as stock. This is by design and reflects the fact you probably have less science to 
  transmit anyway now.
  
FAQ

- Why don't I just use "mod x/y/z" that lets me send stuff without penalty already?

  This mod doesn't turn on infinate electricity in the cheat menu like some, it is designed to adjust 
  the transmission mechanics of the game to be less "no power spammy".
  
- Hey! I ran out of electric and got the power message spam! You're useless!

  Again, this isn't a "turn on infinite electricity" mod. Although it will allow data to be transmitted 
  more successfully than not, it still requires electricity. If you have no solar panels/antennae then the
  mod disables itself. Likewise, if you have those components but your current stored electrical capacity 
  is very low, it will run out of electricity as normal. It is recommended to keep an additional battery on 
  the vessel to allow for a 'reserve' when in darkness and keep the MANGO abilities working correctly.
