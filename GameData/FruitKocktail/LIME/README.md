# Lie In Must Ensue (L.I.M.E)
DESCRIPTION

On Kerbal Space Program, I personally don't enjoy launching rockets or planes etc in the dark so am an avid user of "Warp To Sunrise". Unfortunately, the game 
defines "Sunrise" as dawn, which is still too dark for my liking. 

This mini-mod originally changed the "Warp To Sunrise" time to an hour later so it was brighter and sunnier. However, due to requests from several players, you 
now have the option of selecting a preset time to warp to.

Go on, have yourself a lie in.

INSTRUCTIONS

- warp time options are available via the toolbar icon when at the Space Center.
- You can select either (i) Sunrise (the stock time), (ii) Sunny (the orignal LIME sunny time), (iii) Sunset or (iv) Midnight to suit your mood / game objective.
