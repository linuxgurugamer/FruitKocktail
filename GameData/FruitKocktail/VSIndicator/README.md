# Vertikal Speed Indicator

DESCRIPTION

This is a simple mod which gives the player a quick reference to their vessel's current vertical speed by 
changing the colour of the NavBall text according to whether they are ascending or descending. 

When you are trying to manually land and reducing velocity, often newer players can 'overburn' which results 
in the speed switching to a positive figure (and the vessel lifts up again). Unfortunately, in stock, there is 
no indication as to which direction the velocity is being applied (other than the tiny VS dial at the top of the screen which 
is difficult to see, inaccurate and in the wrong position). Additionally, if the player has the SAS set to 
retrograde (as instructed in the tutorials), because the prograde/retrograde markers switch positions during such 
an event, the vessel can sometimes turn upside down and/or spin which a newer player (and some more experienced!) can 
struggle to recover from.

This mod attempts to address the above by changing the colour of the text, depending on whether the player is ascending or 
descending. There is also an option to set an alternative colour and "safe velocity" for fine tuning purposes. 
Therefore, with practice, it's possible to manually land without locking the SAS to the retrograde marker. 
Additionally, this teaches the player fine throttle control as they get instant feedback on their adjustments whilst 
attempting to (for example) hover.

DETAILS

- the mod only affects the NavBall when in "Surface Mode". It doesn't change the colour when in "Orbit Mode" or 
  "Target Mode". Usually the game switches to "Surface Mode" as you are sub-orbital and slowing down but you can 
  of course manually change it by clicking on the speed.
  
-  Click the VSI toolbar button to bring up the menu. Here you can select the colour for ascending, descending and safe velocity 
   by moving the sliders. The colour options are Green (stock), Red, Orange, Yellow, Cyan, Blue, Magenta, Pink and White.
   
-  The last slider allows you to select which velocity is classed as the threshold for "safe", with ranges from 0 - 20 m/s in line 
   with the stock navball velocity reading.

-  If you're happy and no longer need to change the colour, you can disable the toolbar button by pressing 
    Escape -> Settings -> (your difficulty setting): Options -> Vertikal Speed Indicator -> Press the "Disable Toolbar Button" button. 
    You can also see which colours have been saved here. To reactivate it, just uncheck the toggle. Changes are made once you apply or 
    accept the changes on the pause menu.
