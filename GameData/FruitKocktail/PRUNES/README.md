# Potentially Really Useful New Editor Sorter (P.R.U.N.E.S.)

DESCRIPTION

When you go into the Editor, do you find yourself constantly sorting the parts by something other than the default "Sort By Name" setting?
Isn't constantly switching to your preferred sort order a tedius and unwelcome affair? 

You need a tin of prunes.

PRUNES automatically sets the sort order to your preferred setting (configurable via the Pause Menu/Settings/Difficulty Options; move the slider
for each option) to automatically sort the parts by either Name (the default), Mass, Cost or Size. You can also specify ascending/descending. 
PRUNES defaults to Mass/Ascending which seems to be the preferred setting for many players, although my personal preference is by Size, but that's 
just me.
