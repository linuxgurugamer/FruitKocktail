# Filling Inventory Generously (F.I.G.)

DESCRIPTION

Managed to destroy a solar panel on your ship and now have no power? You check the crew manifest... there is an Engineer onboard - great. 
Let's get him to repair it... wait, you forgot to bring any repair kits didn't you? Hardly surprising given the tedious nature of loading 
the inventory with them.

This mini-mod basically fills any empty inventory slots contained with Command Modules at launch so you've always got a supply when you need
them.


INSTRUCTIONS

- Fill any inventory slots in Command Pods as you require and launch the vessel. Any slots inside the Command Pod not occupied will be 
  filled with a full stack of 4 repair kits.
- This only works on Command Pods (by design). Kerbal and dedicated cargo storage containers are not affected, as there is a potential 
  for a ridiculous number being available which is just unrealistic.
