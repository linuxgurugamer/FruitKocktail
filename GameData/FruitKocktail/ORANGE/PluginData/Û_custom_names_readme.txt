ORANGE Naming Notes

(1)	NEVER remove the actual text file (first.txt and second.txt) as the mod will not work without both files present.

(2)	If you want the mod to select from a single list, open up the list you don't want, then delete all the entries and save (so the file will exist but it'll be empty).

(3) If adding new names or replacing those contained, keep to the same format (ie 1 per line). The mod doesn't handle grammatical formatting so ensure apostrophes etc are added in the list.

(4) Avoid having empty lines as these will either be interpreted as "   " rather than nothing so the name generated will be/contain blanks!

(5)	For reference, the mod uses Proper Nouns (ie names) and adjectives inside the first list, and nouns inside the second to create it's style. You can of course customise those to suit.
