	description = Much like an avarice child sticking their finger in every cupcake at a party to claim it as their's, this sign does the same for Uranus Gas when added to a space station. However, this will allow you to refuel without the hassle of mining and transporting fuel, which is useful, unlike the child who will probably just vomit everywhere.
