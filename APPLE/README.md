# Automated Popular Pre-Launch Experiment (A.P.P.L.E.)

DESCRIPTION

A small mod to eleviate some of the more monotonous tasks in KSP:

- auto turn on SAS for vessels that you usually turn it on for
- auto setting of lower/left UI to maneuver node mode to see ap/pe info rather than attitude
- auto apply brakes to rovers and planes so stop them rolling away on start
- auto toggle active vessel lights depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto toggle Kerbal helmet lights depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto toggle Kerbal visor (up/down) depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto remove/add Kerbal helmet if safe to remove / unsafe to be off
- auto SAS mode to "Node" when you create a maneauver node
- auto landing gear deployment/retraction; altitudes vary per vessel type
- warp lead time changed from 30 secs to 10 secs


NOTES

- Options are configurable to be on/off in the Game Settings menu should you not require certain options
- Vessel lights currently only trigger when vessel is active, to save resources.

TODO
Add KSPwheel support
