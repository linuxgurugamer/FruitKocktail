# Programatic Extension And Retraction (P.E.A.R.)


DESCRIPTION

Sick of hunting around in the dark for each solar panel, antenna or radiator to manually extend? 
Forgot to set them all as an Action Group in Editor but have only found out now, 10 minutes into
your mission? Realised you don't want to extend the panels inside that cargo bay but it's too late/
awkward to change it?

You need a slice of PEAR.

PEAR adds a microprocessor to each solar panel, radiator and antennae on your vessel. These microprocessors 
can communicate with each other and send simple commands to each to create a local network of sorts. The 
result is, when you right click the part, there is an option to extend/retract ALL other parts in the 
network with a single click. You can also disconnect a part from the network so it won't be controlled 
should you not wish to extend a panel whilst it's inside a cargo bay for example.





INSTRUCTIONS

- PEAR is automatically added to all solar panels, radiators and antennae (included mods assuming they use 
  the same Extending Module the stock parts use - which they normally do), with the exception of the 
  non-deploying OX-Stat stock panels.
- You can pre-disable a part in the Editor by right clicking and turning it off using the button. The status
  message will confirm whether it is on or off. In flight, the same option is available allowing you to 
  re-link the part to the network or remove as required.
- Right click the part and select "Extend All Extendables" and all parts connected to the network will 
  extend along with the part you're operating. Conversely, to retract all, click "Retract All 
  Extendables" (only one option is available at a time).
- Any parts connected will still be subject to stock abilities (can still extend/retract independently, 
  will still be unable to extend if stowed ie in a cargo bay).
- As a bonus, the "one-shot" non-retractable stock panels are now retractable.
