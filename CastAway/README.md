# KastAway

DESCRIPTION

A novelty prop from the Kerbal Film Studios, this was used in the film Kast Away! This prop contains a raft, a sail made out of a metal portaloo side 
and a volleyball mounted on a stick. The raft works and harnesses the power of the wind to move you around the surface of the water!


INSTRUCTIONS

- The raft requires all 3 parts in order to function (the raft as a base, then the sail and wilson stick surface attached).
- It is highly recommended you place an external command seat on the raft so your Kerbal can operate it.
- Ensure the raft is in the water, then right click to bring up the menu.
- The wind speed will be displayed on the menu; this varies per instance between 5 and 12kts. Obviously the stronger the wind, 
  the faster you will go.
- Click the "Raise Anchor" button to raise the anchor and commence sailing. 

IMPORTANT - this mod introduces a new concept of negative control, whereby when the anchor is released, the raft will be pushed by the wind power 
automatically. The player, instead of being responsible for making the vessel go, is now responsible for making it stop instead.

- Pressing "A" (yaw left) will turn the raft left. Pressing "D" (yaw right) will turn the raft right. Pressing "S" (pitch up) will furl the sails (slow 
you down). As stated above, releasing "S" will unfurl the sails and accelerate you up to top speed.

- To stop sailing, press the (now reading) "Lower Anchor" button which will slow you pretty quickly! You will no longer be suseptible to wind power.

HINT - it is possible to 'beach' the raft which is pretty cool, however keep your speed low (< 10ms) or you'll explode on impact!
