# Oh Really, Another Name Generating Endeavour? (O.R.A.N.G.E.)

DESCRIPTION

Are you sick of struggling with new names for your vessels? Are you fed up with settling for "Hermes"? 
This mod for KSP randomly generates and adds a name to the vessel whilst in the editor in a 'lite' fashion.


NOTES

- Adds a module to all Command Modules (ie pods, probes etc), accesible via a button on the right click 
  menu of the part labeled "Change Name". Just click this and the mod will automatically add a randomly 
  generated name into the Vessel's name box. Don't like the choice? Click again for another.
- Names are generated from 2 x text files. You can add additional names/change etc if desired.You can 
  also set the mod to select from a single list by removing all the entries from the unrequired list
  (but don't remove the file itself!)



FAQ

- Why wouldn't I just use a different generator such as Champagne Bottle?

Some other generators add extras in such as multiple selections, firing people who suggest, different 
groups of names for different types of vessel, etc, etc. I personally didn't need all these aspects 
and just wanted a quick and easy way of naming the vessel without any hassle, hence this mod.
